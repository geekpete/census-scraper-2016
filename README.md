# Census scraper!
The first results for the 2016 Australian census will be available on June 26. However, the first official tabulated data (DataPacks and TableBuilder) won't be available until July 12. 

If you want tabulated data on July 26, this script converts the community profile time series spreadsheets for each sa2 into a single sqlite database for analysis.
