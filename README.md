# Census scraper
The first results for the 2016 Australian census will be available on June 27. However, the first official tabulated data waon't be available until later (TableBuilder on July 4 and DataPacks on July 12).

If you want tabulated data on June 27, this script converts the community profile time series spreadsheets for each sa2 into a single sqlite database for analysis.

It's pretty rough and is currently set up to work with the 2011 template, but will be updated on the morning of June 26 (also see comments in the code).

Feel free to use this, but if you do and you find it useful please let me know.
